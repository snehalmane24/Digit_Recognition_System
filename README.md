### Digit Recognition System using MNIST Dataset
- **Setup:**
  - Installed **TensorFlow**
  - Loaded the **MNIST dataset**
  - Explored the dataset structure (checking image shape, labels, etc.)
  - Rechecked data for consistency
  - Normalized the data (scaled pixel values to the range [0,1])
- **Model Architecture:**
  - Built a **Sequential Keras model**
  - Added:
    - Two pairs of **Conv2D** and **MaxPooling2D** layers
    - **Flatten** layer to convert 2D feature maps to 1D
    - **Dense** layer for classification
- **Process:**
  - Compiled the model (specified loss function, optimizer, and metrics)
  - Trained the model with the training data
  - Evaluated the model accuracy on test data
  - Saved the trained model in **HDF5** format
  - Used the saved model to perform digit predictions
- **Tools:**
  - **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for building and training the model.
